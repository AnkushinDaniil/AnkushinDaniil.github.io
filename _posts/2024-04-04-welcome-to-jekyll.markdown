### Hello!

This is my first post on my blog. It's worth saying that I'm not a native speaker, so reasonable criticism is acceptable. My name is Daniil and I am a software developer at the beginning of my professional career.

At the moment I have a master's degree in light guide photonics and programmable electronics and a lot of experience in this field. Nevertheless, I decided to change my career path due to my passion for blockchain technologies, especially [Ethereum][ethereum].

### Why is ethereum?

I'm really excited about this technology because of its transparency, trustlessness, and permissionlessness. Inheriting some of bitcoin's props and expanding the blockchain's capabilities from its sole purpose, which is actually money transfer, to a much wider range of possibilities, Ethereum became the second blockchain in terms of the amount of assets. However, I believe it will become the first in the future.

### Scalability issues

Unfortunately, there is a [trilemma][trilemma] in Ethereum's scalability. There are many [approaches][approaches] to solve this problem, e.g. sharding for L1 and rollups for L2 (there are many more, but these are the most known). From my point of view, ZK rollups have the most potential. I'm also convinced that open source projects are the best projects, so I decided to study Ethereum, zk rollups and improve it by contributing to open source projects.

### The purpose of the blog

Therefore the blog appeared. I want to share my journey with the world and get feedback to increase our common development.
